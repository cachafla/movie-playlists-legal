  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>How do I create a playlist?</h3>
  <p>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button on the Playlists tab. You can describe what you're looking for in plain English (e.g., "cozy 90s comedies") and let AI generate a lineup, or search for and add movies manually.</p>

  <h3>How do AI recommendations work?</h3>
  <p>Type a description of the kind of movies you want — genre, era, mood, theme, or anything else — and the App uses AI to build a curated playlist. Each movie is scored and filtered to match your request as closely as possible.</p>

  <h3>How do I add friends?</h3>
  <p>Go to the <strong>Friends</strong> tab and tap <strong>Add Friend</strong>. Search by name or email. Your friend will receive a friend request notification and can accept or decline.</p>

  <h3>How do I share a playlist?</h3>
  <p>Open any playlist, tap the share icon, and choose a friend. You can grant view-only or edit access. They'll receive a notification with a link to the playlist.</p>

  <h3>How do I mark a movie as watched?</h3>
  <p>Open the movie's detail page and tap <strong>Mark as Watched</strong>. You can also mark movies from within a playlist. Watched movies appear in your stats and history.</p>

  <h3>Where do the ratings come from?</h3>
  <p>Movie Playlists shows ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic aggregated in one view so you don't have to check multiple apps.</p>

  <h3>How do I sign in with Apple instead of Google?</h3>
  <p>On the sign-in screen, tap <strong>Sign in with Apple</strong>. If you already have an account with the same email address, it will link automatically — your playlists and data carry over seamlessly.</p>

  <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
  <p>Go to <strong>Profile → Delete Account</strong>. Deletion is permanent and removes all your playlists, watch history, and friend connections from our servers.</p>

  <h3>The app is crashing or behaving unexpectedly</h3>
  <p>Make sure you're running the latest version of the App and the latest version of iOS. If the problem persists, email us with your device model, iOS version, and a description of what happened and we'll look into it.</p>

  <h3>How do I turn off push notifications?</h3>
  <p>Go to <strong>Settings → Notifications → Movie Playlists</strong> on your device and toggle notifications off. You can also control individual notification types there.</p>
