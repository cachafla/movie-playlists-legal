  <p>Movie Playlists ("the App") is developed by Andrés Vallecilla. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <li>To save your playlists, watch history, and preferences</li>

    <li>To send push notifications (e.g., when a friend shares a playlist with you)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not use your data for advertising.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses the following third-party services to operate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In / Sign in with Apple</strong> — for authentication. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a> respectively.</li>
    <li><strong>The Movie Database (TMDB)</strong> — for movie metadata, images, and search. Subject to <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy">TMDB's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> — to generate playlist recommendations from your text descriptions. Your prompt text is sent to OpenAI to produce recommendations. Subject to <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>OMDb API</strong> — for IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic ratings. No personal data is shared with OMDb.</li>
